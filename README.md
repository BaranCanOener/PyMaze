# PyMaze
A backtracking algorithm in Python to create random mazes, using pygame for the graphical output.

The algorithm allows for the length of hallways to be adjusted in levels ranging between 0 and 9 (essentially making it that times more likely to keep the current direction). The codebase can be improved by already saving the path to the mazes end during the creation step, but I liked the two separate illustrations of the backtracking algorithm in succession.
